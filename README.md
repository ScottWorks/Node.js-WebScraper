## Motivation

This is basically my sandbox for playing around with WebScraping, I started off using [this tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-ultimate-guide-to-web-scraping-with-node-js-daa2027dcd3).

## Getting Started

1. Fork then clone this repo
2. In the command-line navigate to the root of the project folder.
3. Enter `npm install`
4. Navigate to one of the project sub-folders (i.e. `./cherio`, `./puppeteer`, etc)
5. Enter `nodemon`, (NOTE: if you are not using nodemon, enter `node index.js`)
6. You should now see stuff happening in the terminal or browser.
